[@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll) will be integrating these themes into PSU but I've made them available here ahead of time if you're interested in using them now.

This is a project that smashes themes from [windowsterminalthemes.dev](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/) into PowerShell Universal's underlying framework, [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

You can learn how the theming engine was designed at [Steph Hays' blog](https://stephhays.dev/blog/designing-the-kbupdate-dashboard-components-with-powershell-universal), which features this awesome demo video.

If you can't figure out how to run this in your own PowerShell Universal instance, here's a massive screenshot of the options.
