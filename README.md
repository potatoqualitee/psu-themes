[@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll) will be integrating these themes into PSU but I've made them available here ahead of time if you're interested in using them now.

This is a project that smashes themes from [windowsterminalthemes.dev](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/) into PowerShell Universal's underlying framework, [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

If you can't figure out how to run this in your own PowerShell Universal instance, here's a massive screenshot of the options.
